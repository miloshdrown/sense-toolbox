Some code optimizations

2.4.1:
Fix for Bypass lockscreen option, doesn't dismiss lockscreen on incoming call and alarm ringer.
Added waring that 7 homescreen mod will not work on HTC One on Android 4.2.2. (Dual SIM One still has 4.2.2)

2.4:
Re-added 4x1 widget transparanecy for Sense 5.5
"Bypass lock screen on wake" setting works also without screen lock.
Sense launcher home screens grid 4x5. All widgets became resizable.
Horizontal EQS are now long-clickable! Brings you to the respective settings. Works with APN, Autosync, Bluetooth, Brightness, DND, GPS, Mobile Data, Powersaver, Screenshot, WiFi, WiFi Hotspot.
Screen on and off animations. Screen on: Fade. Screen off: Fade or CRT.
Fast unlock for HTC lockscreen. No need to hit "Enter" key. Device will unlock as soon as correct PIN is entered.
Display memory usage in recent apps list.
Long press menu for apps in recent apps list. (Enabled by default)
Display package version in title when installing or updating app. (Enabled by default)
New options for volume bottons in camera: Zoom in and out.
Option to remove icon labels on Sense launcher homescreens.

2.3:
Added mod to display current data rate (upload+download) on the status bar. Will only be shown, when the device is connected to a network.
Added mod to enable seven home screens on Sense launcher. NOTE: On Sense 5.5 BlinkFeed is counted as a page!
Added CleanBeam Do not disturb and MTP icons.
Minor EQS works with disabled EQS panel.
Pressing menu key with open home popup menu will now close it.
Horizontal EQS can now be used with disabled EQS panel.
Sense 5.5 changes:
	Brought back Hardware info in Settings -> About.
	Removed EQS reorder and BlinkFeed disabling. They are native now.
	Horizontal EQS will use the native order.
	Fixed the mods that were broken.
	Removed 4x1 widget transparency as it has some implications on transparency of other widgets too. May come back in the future.
	Removed infinite home screen scrolling. With BF enabled it's useless due to the new menu, and with BF disabled, it is prone to errors due to BF handling.
	NOTE: App drawer transparency will set BlinkFeed transparency too. They are tied together in Sense 5.5!


2.2:
Kill app on long press back/home assist now kills the complete package including services.
Kill app will give you feedback in form of a vibration, so you know that you actually killed the app and not just pressed back. Respects power saver settings for vibration.
Killing launchers isn't possible anymore. That removes the corresponding dialog too.
Transparency settings can now be enabled and disabled by a new checkbox in the settings dialog. Please re-set your transparency settings.
Soft reboot icon changed again. It now asks for confirmation. I hope this will now clear up any confusion.
Small UI tweaks
Fixed Vol2Wake in deep sleep for some devices/kernels. Thanks to @luxandroid.
Swipe sensitivity is now based on screen size. Makes swipes easier for low-res devices like the One S.
Added MMS size mod. Sizes are 300k, 600k, 1000k. Network restrictions still apply ;)
Added CleanBeam 4G, USB, Powersave, NFC and screenshot icon. Also Airplane mode icon as part of the data icons.
Added Sense launcher home screen popup menu. Acces via Menu, longpress Home or swipe up from launcher dock. Has some useful functions like access to settings, apps manager and APM.
Added mod to force enable "Support SMS special accent characters". Helpful for some specific regions to show actual character count. Code donated by @rumil86 . Thx for that!
Added polish tranlsation by @cvxcvx (Before you ask, I still have no idea how to handle translations in a way that doesn't consume all my time...)

2.1.1
Fix for Vol2Wake. After installation go into the settings, disable Vol2Wake, wait a sec, enable it again, full reboot to apply. You don't need to do it if you don't have problems.
Fix for home assist action on lockscreen.
Fix for misaligned text under CleanBeam settings.
Fixed missing translation.
Added back button to kill option.
App launch on long press back and home assist will now dismiss lockscreen. Only lockscreen, NOT your PIN or pattern lock. I repeat: Toolbox does NOT circumvent your lock :D

2.1:
Swipes are now a bit more sensetive.
Fixed the flashing "more notifications" icon in most places. It still may happen when you come from camera app. Just wait until it updates...

2.0: (Yes, that completely new look is a major release :D)
Total UI overhaul.
The Toolbox is now accessible through the phone settings.
Landscape orientation is now possible.
Added "About" screen.
Wallpaper is not removed when in appdrawer and dock is transparent, prevents dock black background.
Center clock is now really in the center.
Notification icons will now only go up until they reach the center clock. This is instant for notification icons a may be a bit delayed for the right hand icons.
Added option to remove status bar clock.
Added option to hide AM and PM.
You need to re-set your desired clock style, cause of the added options!
Added check if xposed is actually installed. Maybe this will reduce the amount of questions a bit ;)
Added mod that allows to assign different options to swipe up/down gestures on Sense launcher home screens. Currently included: Pull down notifications, EQS and lock device. Device lock needs a device admin to be activated.
Added option to lower the font size in app drawer. Useful if you use higher grid values. (Enabled by default)

Fixed status bar background image. No more dissortion now.

1.6:
Changed layout of the mods settings page. It got a bit cluttered with the number of mods there :D

Fix for 100% transparency settings on status bar and dock.

	Sorry, but this is the last transparency mod I'm going to add. 
	Other mods like blinkfeed or app drawer background seem to use a Prism.apk from another device. 
	Replicating that in xposed would be a huge overhead IMHO. 
	Maybe some other dev can point me in the right direction...

Added possibility to remove folder limit (Was 16 apps per folder)
Added option to disable the sound that plays on volume change by buttons
