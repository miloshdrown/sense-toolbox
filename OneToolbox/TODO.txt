1.1:
Updated support post link.
Added more info about APM.
Add version string to the bottom title and support entry.
Disable EQS feautre if root is not available. Xposed Mods still work.
Delete tmp.xml directly after use. No need to keep it.
Removed some unneded logging stuff.
Added "Force focus, then shutter" option to the camera mod.
Added transparent status bar.
Added 'Keep screen on' option in display and dev settings.
Added transparent Sense launcher dock. This has a delay, which can't be fixed for now, sorry. It's the same on a native mod.
