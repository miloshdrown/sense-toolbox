1.3:
Added One X compatibility for EQS reorder. Mods untested by me (no HOX here), but should work too.

1.2: 
Added horizontal EQS. The First 5 of your normal EQS will be used there.
Added options to set custom transparency values for: Status bar, Prism dock background.
Fixed transparent Statusbar in combination with battery icon.
Complete change of the Xposed module hook structure for easier addition of new mods. Also lower overhead.

1.1: 296 DLs
Updated support post link.
Added more info about APM.
Add version string to the bottom title and support entry.
Disable EQS feautre if root is not available. Xposed Mods still work.
Delete tmp.xml directly after use. No need to keep it.
Removed some unneded logging stuff.
Added "Force focus, then shutter" option to the camera mod.
Added transparent status bar.
Added 'Keep screen on' option in display and dev settings.
Added transparent Sense launcher dock. This has a delay, which can't be fixed for now, sorry. It's the same on a native mod.
