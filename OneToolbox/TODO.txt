1.5
Added transparency setting for notification drawer background.
Added option to dsable forced SMS to MMS conversion. Network restrictions still apply!

1.4:
Unified app for One, One X and One X+ - Now called Sense 5 Toolbox!
Added transparency for the standard HTC clock + weather widget
	Sorry, but this is the last transparency mod I'm going to add. 
	Other mods like blinkfeed or app drawer background seem to use a Prism.apk from another device. 
	Replicating that in xposed would be a huge overhead IMHO. 
	Maybe some other dev can point me in the right direction...
Added 'Screen on on received SMS' mod.
Added possibility to remove folder limit (Was 16 apps per folder)
Added option to disable the sound that plays on volume change by buttons

Added horizontal EQS. The First 5 of your normal EQS will be used there.
Added options to set custom transparency values for: Status bar, Prism dock background.
Fixed transparent Statusbar in combination with battery icon.
Complete change of the Xposed module hook structure for easier addition of new mods. Also lower overhead.

Updated support post link.
Added more info about APM.
Add version string to the bottom title and support entry.
Disable EQS feautre if root is not available. Xposed Mods still work.

Added "Force focus, then shutter" option to the camera mod.
Added transparent status bar.
