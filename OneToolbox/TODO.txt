Landscape orientation is now possible.
Added "About" screen.
Wallpaper is not removed when in appdrawer and dock is transparent, prevents dock black background.

	Sorry, but this is the last transparency mod I'm going to add. 
	Other mods like blinkfeed or app drawer background seem to use a Prism.apk from another device. 
	Replicating that in xposed would be a huge overhead IMHO. 
	Maybe some other dev can point me in the right direction...
