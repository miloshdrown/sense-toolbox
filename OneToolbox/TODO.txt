- "is it possible to get Always extended lockscreen widget like there is in Orio Rom?"
- Other apps in HTC lock screen notifications
- HDMI output with screen off (Don't have such an adapter...)
- Day of week next to clock (isn't the status bar crowded enough?
- Battery bar
- Exchange security mod
- More options for brightnes slider
- gallery statusbar transparency. (Saw today that's an issue with all components using SurfaceView. Saw it in FourSquare map view)
- That mod: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=45931184&postcount=46834 (No idea...)
- Only one toast for group notifications
- Small font also on home screens
- 2 finger swipes
- switch to zoe on camera volume buttons
- Camera: Press both buttons for an action
- Remove Sense lockscreen weather widget.

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfCa3JtGpxc
- Change carrier label on lockscreen and notification drawer
- Get rid of some useless icons like Beats and Headphone...
- Auto close EQS after setting changed
- Go to recent apps as swipe action (swipe where? all Sense swipes are not going to work for foreground apps, obviously, might just remove this todo)
- Custom graphics (CleanBeam-styled?) for EQS
- Optional dock swipe to menu (I don't think so :D)
- Scrollable wallpaper
- Sound profile in APM (not worth it)
- Owner/carrier info on Lockscreen
